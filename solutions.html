         <p>Climate change is happening due to human activities and its threatening the way we live and the future of our planet. These activities result in various impacts on the climate. In order to tackle these impacts, first we need to identify the human activities that cause the changes and find solutions for them. Some of the human activities leading to climate change are mentioned below.</p><br><br>
         <div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>BURNING FOSSIL FUELS</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="fossil.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>When fossil fuels are burned, they release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. The most common nitrogen-related compounds emitted into the air by human activities are collectively referred to as nitrogen oxides. It also releases large amounts of carbon dioxide which is a green house gas that contributes to global warming.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="5"><center><b>RELEASING CHEMICALS TO ENVIRONMENT</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="toxic.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Many chemicals and chemical products are considered essential to modern life because of the benefits they provide. Some break down quickly, while others persist for long periods in the environment and may bioaccumulate in the food chain which are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>DEFORESTATION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="deforest.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling combined account for more than half of all deforestation. Forestry practices, wildfires and, in small part, urbanization account for the rest. In Malaysia and Indonesia, forests are cut down to make way for producing palm oil, which can be found in everything from shampoo to saltines. In the Amazon, cattle ranching and farms,particularly soy plantations are key culprits.</p>
</div>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>RAPID EXPANSION OF FARMING</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="farming.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Agriculture contributes a significant share of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are causing climate change – 17% directly through agricultural activities and an additional 7-14% through changes in land use. ... Both of these gases have a significantly higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>URBARNIZATION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="urban.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Urbanization would increase the emission of atmospheric pollutants, cause the heat island effect, and lead to the land use change. The volatile air layer can lead to the thermal convection easily due to the urban heat island effect, which can increase thermal convection and convective precipitation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>INDUSTRIALIZATION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="industry.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Industrialization is the transformation of a society from agrarian to a manufacturing or industrial economy. Industrialization contributes to negative externalities such as environmental pollution that includes air and water pollution and soil contamination that resulted in a significant deterioration of quality of life and life expectancy. </p>

<br><font size="10" color="#edd924"><b>EFFECTS</b></font></h2><br>
         <p>Humans and wild animals face new challenges for survival because of climate change. Various actions of nature whichare unintentional and actions of human which are intentional lead to catastropic changes in the climate. Some of these problems are discussed below.</p><br><br>
         <div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>GLOBAL WARMING</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="global.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. It stresses ecosystems through temperature rises, water shortages, increased fire threats, drought, weed and pest invasions, intense storm damage and salt invasion, just to name a few.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>RISE IN SEA-LEVEL</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="sea.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Global mean sea level has risen about 8–9 inches (21–24 centimeters) since 1880, with about a third of that coming in just the last two and a half decades. When sea levels rise as rapidly as they have been, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal habitats farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>DESERTIFICATION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="desert.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Desertification, also called desertization, the process by which natural or human causes reduce the biological productivity of drylands. It makes natural disasters worse because it reduces natural resilience of ecosystems. Events such as flash floods, landslides and dust storms, become stronger in areas with heavily degraded soils.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="greenhouse.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Greenhouse gases have far-ranging environmental and health effects. They cause climate change by trapping heat, and they also contribute to respiratory disease from smog and air pollution. Extreme weather, food supply disruptions, and increased wildfires are other effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gases.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>AIR POLLUTION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="air.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Air pollution can damage crops and trees in a variety of ways. Ground-level ozone can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, reduced growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and increased plant susceptibility to disease, pests and other environmental stresses.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>WATER POLLUTION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="water.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>When water pollution causes an algal bloom in a lake or marine environment, the proliferation of newly introduced nutrients stimulates plant and algae growth, which in turn reduces oxygen levels in the water. Water pollution is the release of substances into bodies of water that makes water unsafe for human use and disrupts aquatic ecosystems. It can be caused by a plethora of different contaminants, including toxic waste, petroleum, and disease-causing microorganisms. </p>

 <br><font size="10" color="#edd924"><b>SOLUTIONS</b></font></h2><br>
         <p>After identifying the human activities and the results of those actions towards climate change, next we have to find solutions to negate these impacts. Some solutions identified so far are mentioned below. </p><br><br>
         <div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>REFORESTATION</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="reforest.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Reforestation helps in preserving various species of animals and plants that are affected due to the deforestation process. The importance of reforestation is not only limited to the environment but also helps in preserving wildlife. Reforestation has the potential to restore various habitats and save many lives.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>ECO-FRIENDLY ENERGY SOURCES</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="solar.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Renewable energies are sources of clean, inexhaustible and increasingly competitive energy. They differ from fossil fuels principally in their diversity, abundance and potential for use anywhere on the planet, but above all in that they produce neither greenhouse gases which cause climate change nor polluting emissions. Some types of renewable sources are solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, biogas etc.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>CIRCULAR ECONOMY</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="circle.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>The circular economy framework for human production and consumption is an alternative to the traditional, linear concept of 'take, make, and dispose'. Circular economy (CE) principles comprise of 'design out waste and pollution', 'retain products and materials in use', and 'regenerate natural systems'. </p>
</div>
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column1" style="background-color:none;">
  		<font size="6"><center><b>REDUCE THE USAGE OF PLASTIC</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="plastic.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>Reducing the use of plastic is important because plastic production requires an enormous amount of energy and resources. This causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. The benefits of reducing plastic consumption include: Preventing pollution by lessening the amount of new raw materials used. Saves energy. Reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute towards climate change.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column2" style="background-color: none">
  		<font size="5"><center><b>SWITCH TO SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="transport.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
    <p>Sustainable transport can save you money, improve your health and reduce your environmental footprint.Reduced traffic congestion. Reduced air pollution and related risks such as asthma. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Reduced dependence on non-renewable energy sources.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column3" style="background-color:none;">
  	<font size="6"><center><b>PROTECT OCEANS</b></center></font><br>
  	<center><img src="ocean.jpg" width=350 height=170></center>
   <p>A healthy ocean regulates climate and reduce climate change impacts. Ocean currents distribute heat across the globe, regulating temperature and weather. The ocean also absorbs over 90% of the heat and approximately 30% of carbon dioxide emissions produced by human activities.Some species of marine life will continue to migrate, while others will be killed off.</p>
