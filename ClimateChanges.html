      <center><img src="fish.jpg" width=200 height=200></center><br>
      <p>Waste management is an essential service to ensure the continuity of the conservation value of the Horton Plains National Park (HPNP) and Peak Wilderness Nature Reserve (PWNR). These two locations are managed by the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) of the Government of Sri Lanka and known to have high visitor numbers. A short-term project was developed by the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) and IUCN to develop an approach to ensure the long-term sustainability of the HPNP and PWNR conservational value by improving waste management and visitor information services.</p></font>

   <p>The 30-MW Moragolla Hydropower Plant proposed by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was approved by Central Environmental Authority after evaluating the proposal under EIA regulations with specific mitigation measures. As part of the ADB environmental safeguards, fish surveys were undertaken on behalf of CEB in 2016-2017 by National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) which identified Labeo fisheri being present in the dam site area. As the project may have a direct impact on the critical habitat of Labeo fisheri, ADB required a critical habitat assessment to be conducted.</p></font></center>

      <center><img src="5254.jpg" width=200 height=200></center>
      <p>The project aims to facilitate a public-private partnership to pilot an agroforestry approach in degraded coconut and tea plantations, with the aim to enhance environmental as well as socio-economic sustainability of the production systems at the pilot plantations. For the long term, the project aims to develop guidelines on how to sustainably manage degraded lands in tea and coconut plantations, by applying an agroforestry approach. The project will empower a mechanism, facilitated by a team of experts, to coordinate and create active partnerships with key actors (both direct and indirect) of the two sectors to review, upscale and institutionalize agroforestry practices in the tea and coconut plantations in Sri Lanka.</p></font>

      <p>The project aims to conserve biodiversity, maintain watershed services and increase resilience to climate change for the benefit of local communities, agriculture and the local economy of both the Puwakpitiya mini-watershed and of the wider watershed area. Conservation and management of the watershed is expected to see an increase in biodiversity and ecosystem services such as watershed services, micro-climate regulation and carbon sequestration among many others, enhancing the potential for socio-economic and environmental benefits.Restored the Puwakpitiya Mini watershed in Knuckles Mountain Range and Increase the resilience to climate change and dependency of communities on the forest </p></font>

      <center><img src="barb.jpg" width=200 height=200></center>
      <p>The Bandula barb (Pethia bandula) is a Critically Endangered and point endemic species. This means that it can only be found in a 1.5 km long stream that flows through Galapitamada, Sri Lanka. Unlike other Rare and Critically Endangered species, Bandula Barb lives outside the protected area network of Sri Lanka. In 2013, IUCN initiated a project to implement the Bandula Barb Conservation Action Plan. IUCN worked closely with the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Forest Department and Divisional Secretariat of Warakapola and local community to implement project activities.Establish a second population of Bandula Barb inside the protected area. Increase the Bandula Barb population and preserve the species' habitat.Establish community-based mechanism to conserve Bandula Barb.</p></font>

      <p>Anantara has partnered with IUCN Sri Lanka to implement a Marine Turtle Conservation and Enhancement project, with the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) as the government agency partner. In addition to implementing methods to protect and conserve these globally threatened marine turtles, the project will educate local communities, hotel staff and guests on the importance of species conservation. Conduct in-situ conservation of marine turtles, and contribute towards conserving globally threatened species.Raise awareness on marine turtle conservation and enhance field level capacity of DWC to conduct in-situ conservation of marine turtles</p></font>

      <center><img src="range.jpg" width=200 height=200></center>
      <p>Situated approximately four kilometres southwest of Kandy city, biodiversity rich Hanthana Mountain Range extends over the Gangavata, Pathahevaheta, Uda Palata and Deltota Divisional Sectaries Divisions. Hantana Mountain Range was declared an Environmental Protection Area (EPA) and at present, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has the jurisdiction to manage and exercise powers over the EPA. In order to manage and conserve the Hantana EPA effectively, availability of a management plan was vital. To fulfill this need, it was necessary to consider the biodiversity of the site.With efforts to highlight the ecological and socio-economic importance of the Hantana Mountain EPA and minimise threats and pressures, a biodiversity assessment was undertaken by Central Environmental Authority.</p></font>

      <h3><center><b>Maragala Mountain Range Environmental Protection Area</b></center></h3><br>
      <center><img src="maragala.jpg" width=200 height=200></center>
      <p>Maragala Mountain, the highest summit in Monaragala district is rich with biodiversity. “Maragalakanda” also known as the Peacock Hill is an isolated mountain home to several endemic fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species.This mountain range faces pressures such as illegal logging and chena cultivation (slash and burn agriculture) which stem largely from socio-economic issues.
      The assessment of environmentally sensitive areas is a major role of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA). Therefore, in collaboration with IUCN Sri Lanka, CEA initiated the development of a management plan to assess and identify the significance of Maragala EPA. Produced Species inventory including endemic and threatened species. </p></font>

     <h3><center><b>Navy initiates a project in creating Polythene and Plastic free environment</b></center></h3><br>
      <center><img src="navy.jpg" width=200 height=200></center>
      <p>Marine Conservation and Monitoring Unit of Sri Lanka Navy has introduced a new recycling process of polythene and plastic as a sustainable solution for garbage disposal of Sri Lanka.This project consists of three phases and as its first phase production of fancy items, flower pots, fence posts, and interlocks for garden has been tested. It was proved that these items could be produced successfully.In the second phase, it is expected to spread this technology all over the island through the Naval Community Welfare Project and make the general public aware on proper disposal of garbage and how to use garbage as a resource. Further, social organizations will be provided necessary technical assistance in this regard.It has been planned to conduct experiments in identifying methods of disposing non polythene/plastic garbage with the assistance of Naval Research and Development Unit,applying the injection molding technology.</p></font>

      <center><img src="mangrove.jpg" width=200 height=200></center><br>
      <p>The Navy, being a prominent player in conducting environmental conservation programmes, carried out another event to promote productive ecosystems through plantation of mangrove saplings.The programme, in which 1000 mangrove saplings were planted by the Navy, was conducted in the Northern Naval Command from December 2019 to January 2020. Accordingly, the most recent extension of the programme saw plantation of 300 mangrove saplings each by SLNS Elara, Kanchadewa and Welusumana and 100 more mangrove saplings planted by SLNS Gotaimbara in the coastal belt of the Jaffna peninsula.Apart from the conservation of mangrove ecosystem, the Navy has also been conducting a wide range of conservation programmes such as turtle conservation, bio-gas projects, coral conservation etc which contribute significantly to the protection of Sri Lanka's marine and terrestrial ecosystems. </p></font>
